# BFS2D_python
A python code for solving flow across 2D backward facing step.
Vorticity stream formulation has been used to first convert the governing continuity and momentum equations into stream and vorticity equations. 
Finite volume method has been used to discretize the equations.
Pseudo time stepping is used to solve the stream function in explicit manner.
